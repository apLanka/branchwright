# CI/CD and Automation

## Overview

Automate quality gates so that no change reaches production without passing tests, lint, type checking, and build. CI/CD is the enforcement mechanism for every other skill — it catches what humans and agents miss, and it does so consistently on every single change.

**Shift Left:** Catch problems as early in the pipeline as possible. A bug caught in linting costs minutes; the same bug caught in production costs hours. Move checks upstream — static analysis before tests, tests before staging, staging before production.

**Faster is Safer:** Smaller batches and more frequent releases reduce risk, not increase it. A deployment with 3 changes is easier to debug than one with 30. Frequent releases build confidence in the release process itself.

## When to Use

- Setting up a new project's CI pipeline
- Adding or modifying automated checks
- Configuring deployment pipelines
- When a change should trigger automated verification
- Debugging CI failures

## The Quality Gate Pipeline

Every change goes through these gates before merge:

```
Pull Request Opened
    │
    ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│   LINT CHECK     │  eslint, prettier
│   ↓ pass         │
│   TYPE CHECK     │  tsc --noEmit
│   ↓ pass         │
│   UNIT TESTS     │  jest/vitest
│   ↓ pass         │
│   BUILD          │  npm run build
│   ↓ pass         │
│   INTEGRATION    │  API/DB tests
│   ↓ pass         │
│   E2E (optional) │  Playwright/Cypress

│   ↓ pass         │
│   BUNDLE SIZE    │  bundlesize check

```

**No gate can be skipped.** If lint fails, fix lint — don't disable the rule. If a test fails, fix the code — don't skip the test.

## Feeding CI Failures Back to Agents

The power of CI with AI agents is the feedback loop. When CI fails:

```
CI fails
    │
    ▼
Copy the failure output
    │
    ▼
Feed it to the agent:
"The CI pipeline failed with this error:
[paste specific error]
Fix the issue and verify locally before pushing again."
    │
    ▼
Agent fixes → pushes → CI runs again
```

**Key patterns:**

```
Lint failure → Agent runs `npm run lint --fix` and commits
Type error  → Agent reads the error location and fixes the type
Test failure → Agent follows debugging-and-error-recovery skill
Build error → Agent checks config and dependencies
```

## Deployment Strategies

Details: [Deployment Strategies](references/deployment.md) covers: Preview Deployments, Feature Flags, Staged Rollouts, Rollback Plan.

## Environment Management

```
.env.example       → Committed (template for developers)
.env                → NOT committed (local development)
.env.test           → Committed (test environment, no real secrets)
CI secrets          → Stored in GitHub Secrets / vault
Production secrets  → Stored in deployment platform / vault
```

CI should never have production secrets. Use separate secrets for CI testing.

## Automation Beyond CI

Details: [Automation Beyond CI](references/automation.md) covers: Dependabot / Renovate, Build Cop Role, PR Checks.

## CI Optimization

Details: [CI Optimization](references/optimization.md).

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "CI is too slow" | Optimize the pipeline (see CI Optimization below), don't skip it. A 5-minute pipeline prevents hours of debugging. |
| "This change is trivial, skip CI" | Trivial changes break builds. CI is fast for trivial changes anyway. |
| "The test is flaky, just re-run" | Flaky tests mask real bugs and waste everyone's time. Fix the flakiness. |
| "We'll add CI later" | Projects without CI accumulate broken states. Set it up on day one. |
| "Manual testing is enough" | Manual testing doesn't scale and isn't repeatable. Automate what you can. |

## Red Flags

- No CI pipeline in the project
- CI failures ignored or silenced
- Tests disabled in CI to make the pipeline pass
- Production deploys without staging verification
- No rollback mechanism
- Secrets stored in code or CI config files (not secrets manager)
- Long CI times with no optimization effort

## Verification

After setting up or modifying CI:

- [ ] All quality gates are present (lint, types, tests, build, audit)
- [ ] Pipeline runs on every PR and push to main
- [ ] Failures block merge (branch protection configured)
- [ ] CI results feed back into the development loop
- [ ] Secrets are stored in the secrets manager, not in code
- [ ] Deployment has a rollback mechanism
- [ ] Pipeline runs in under 10 minutes for the test suite
