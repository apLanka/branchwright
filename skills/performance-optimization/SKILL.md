description: Optimizes application performance across frontend, backend, queries, and databases. Use when performance requirements exist, when you suspect performance regressions, when Core Web Vitals or load times need improvement, when N+1 query patterns need fixing, or when profiling reveals bottlenecks.

# Performance Optimization

## Overview

Measure before optimizing. Performance work without measurement is guessing — and guessing leads to premature optimization that adds complexity without improving what matters. Profile first, identify the actual bottleneck, fix it, measure again. Optimize only what measurements prove matters.

## When to Use

- Performance requirements exist in the spec (load time budgets, response time SLAs)
- Users or monitoring report slow behavior
- Core Web Vitals scores are below thresholds
- You suspect a change introduced a regression
- Building features that handle large datasets or high traffic

**When NOT to use:** Don't optimize before you have evidence of a problem. Premature optimization adds complexity that costs more than the performance it gains.

## Core Web Vitals Targets

| Metric | Good | Needs Improvement | Poor |
|--------|------|-------------------|------|
| **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint) | ≤ 2.5s | ≤ 4.0s | > 4.0s |
| **INP** (Interaction to Next Paint) | ≤ 200ms | ≤ 500ms | > 500ms |
| **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift) | ≤ 0.1 | ≤ 0.25 | > 0.25 |

## The Optimization Workflow

Details: [The Optimization Workflow](references/workflow.md) covers: Step 1: Measure, Where to Start Measuring, Step 2: Identify the Bottleneck, Step 3: Fix the Bottleneck, Step 4: Verify (Keep or Revert), Log every attempt, including the reverted ones, Step 5: Guard Against Regression.

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "We'll optimize later" | Performance debt compounds. Fix obvious anti-patterns now, defer micro-optimizations. |
| "It's fast on my machine" | Your machine isn't the user's. Profile on representative hardware and networks. |
| "This optimization is obvious" | If you didn't measure, you don't know. Profile first. |
| "Users won't notice 100ms" | Research shows 100ms delays impact conversion rates. Users notice more than you think. |
| "The framework handles performance" | Frameworks prevent some issues but can't fix N+1 queries or oversized bundles. |
| "The query is slow, add an index" | Read the plan first. The index may already exist and be unusable, and every index taxes writes forever. |
| "Just cache it" | Caching an already-cheap call buys nothing and adds a staleness bug. Cache what is expensive *and* re-read far more than written. |
| "Raise the pool size, we're running out of connections" | A pool bigger than the database can serve moves the queue somewhere less visible. Find what holds connections. |
| "It didn't help much, but it doesn't hurt" | Neutral changes are a revert. You pay maintenance on them forever and got nothing back. |
| "We already wrote it, may as well keep it" | Sunk cost. The measurement doesn't care how long the change took to write. |
| "The improvement is obvious, no need to re-measure" | Then re-measuring is cheap and proves it. Unmeasured wins are how neutral complexity lands. |

## Red Flags

- Optimization without profiling data to justify it
- N+1 query patterns in data fetching
- An index added without a query plan before and after to justify it
- A cache key that omits an input the response depends on (tenant, locale, viewer)
- A cache with no stated staleness window and no invalidation strategy
- Connection pool size raised in response to exhaustion, without finding what holds connections
- List endpoints without pagination
- Images without dimensions, lazy loading, or responsive sizes
- Bundle size growing without review
- No performance monitoring in production
- `React.memo` and `useMemo` everywhere (overusing is as bad as underusing)
- Optimizations kept without a re-measurement that justifies them
- Several optimizations bundled into one measurement, so no single change can be attributed
- A "win" that required a test to be changed, skipped, or deleted
- The same failed optimization attempted more than once because nobody recorded the first attempt

## Verification

After any performance-related change:

- [ ] Before and after measurements exist (specific numbers)
- [ ] The result was re-measured the same way as the baseline (same command, same conditions)
- [ ] The improvement exceeds run-to-run variance, not just the mean
- [ ] Changes that didn't beat the baseline were reverted, not kept as neutral
- [ ] Attempts are logged, kept and reverted alike, so a dead idea isn't re-run
- [ ] The specific bottleneck is identified and addressed
- [ ] Core Web Vitals are within "Good" thresholds
- [ ] Bundle size hasn't increased significantly
- [ ] No N+1 queries in new data fetching code
- [ ] Any new index is justified by a query plan before and after, and its write cost was considered
- [ ] Any new cache states what it keys on and how it goes stale
- [ ] The measured user-facing metric has a synthetic budget or field monitor that can detect regression
- [ ] Existing tests still pass (optimization didn't break behavior)

## Vetting a measurement

Before you report a speedup, a regression or a choice between options, run [references/benchmark-checklist.md](references/benchmark-checklist.md): limiter, tuning, limits, errors, repeatability, relevance, and whether the work happened inside the timed region.
