description: Hardens code against vulnerabilities. Use when auditing an input handler for vulnerabilities, when handling user input, authentication, data storage, or external integrations, or when checking a login flow is safe against the OWASP Top Ten. Use when building any feature that accepts untrusted data, manages user sessions, or interacts with third-party services. Use when auditing dependencies for known vulnerabilities, triaging package-manager audit findings, or assessing supply-chain risk in a new package. Use when personal data or privacy compliance (GDPR, CCPA) is involved.

# Security and Hardening

## Overview

Security-first development practices for web applications. Treat every external input as hostile, every secret as sacred, and every authorization check as mandatory. Security isn't a phase — it's a constraint on every line of code that touches user data, authentication, or external systems.

## When to Use

- Building anything that accepts user input
- Implementing authentication or authorization
- Storing or transmitting sensitive data
- Integrating with external APIs or services
- Adding file uploads, webhooks, or callbacks
- Handling payment or PII data

## Process: Threat Model First

Controls bolted on without a threat model are guesses. Before hardening, spend five minutes thinking like an attacker:

1. **Map the trust boundaries.** Where does untrusted data cross into your system? HTTP requests, form fields, file uploads, webhooks, third-party APIs, message queues, and **LLM output** — plus the local values that look internal because the OS handed them to you: another process's command line or environment, filenames on a shared volume, a path in a job payload. Trust follows who *wrote* a value, not which channel delivered it. Every boundary is attack surface.
2. **Name the assets.** What's worth stealing or breaking? Credentials, PII, payment data, admin actions, money movement.
3. **Run STRIDE over each boundary** — a quick lens, not a ceremony:

| Threat | Ask | Typical mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **S**poofing | Can someone impersonate a user/service? | Authentication, signature verification |
| **T**ampering | Can data be altered in transit or at rest? | Integrity checks, parameterized queries, HTTPS |
| **R**epudiation | Can an action be denied later? | Audit logging of security events |
| **I**nformation disclosure | Can data leak? | Encryption, field allowlists, generic errors |
| **D**enial of service | Can it be overwhelmed? | Rate limiting, input size caps, timeouts |
| **E**levation of privilege | Can a user gain rights they shouldn't? | Authorization checks, least privilege |

4. **Write abuse cases next to use cases.** For each feature, ask "how would I misuse this?" — then make that your first test.

If you can't name the trust boundaries for a feature, you're not ready to secure it. This is OWASP **A04: Insecure Design** — most breaches begin in design, not code.

## The Three-Tier Boundary System

### Always Do (No Exceptions)

- **Validate all external input** at the system boundary (API routes, form handlers)
- **Parameterize all database queries** — never concatenate user input into SQL
- **Encode output** to prevent XSS (use framework auto-escaping, don't bypass it)
- **Use HTTPS** for all external communication
- **Hash passwords** with bcrypt/scrypt/argon2 (never store plaintext)
- **Set security headers** (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
- **Use httpOnly, secure, sameSite cookies** for sessions
- **Run the detected package manager's native audit** against the committed lockfile before every release

### Ask First (Requires Human Approval)

- Adding new authentication flows or changing auth logic
- Storing new categories of sensitive data (PII, payment info)
- Adding new external service integrations
- Changing CORS configuration
- Adding file upload handlers
- Modifying rate limiting or throttling
- Granting elevated permissions or roles

### Never Do

- **Never commit secrets** to version control (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- **Never log sensitive data** (passwords, tokens, full credit card numbers)
- **Never trust client-side validation** as a security boundary
- **Never disable security headers** for convenience
- **Never use `eval()` or `innerHTML`** with user-provided data
- **Never store sessions in client-accessible storage** (localStorage for auth tokens)
- **Never expose stack traces** or internal error details to users

## Hardening Controls

Details: [Hardening Controls](references/controls.md) covers: Injection, XSS, and access control, Authentication and sessions, Headers, CORS, and responses, Input validation and uploads, Server-side fetches (SSRF), Destructive operations on derived paths, Rate limiting, Secrets, Dependencies and supply chain, Personal data and privacy, AI / LLM features.

## Review Checklist

Before sign-off, walk `../../references/security-checklist.md`: it covers authentication, authorization, input, data protection and privacy, headers and CORS, dependencies and supply chain, AI/LLM, and error handling, plus the OWASP quick-reference tables.

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "This is an internal tool, security doesn't matter" | Internal tools get compromised. Attackers target the weakest link. |
| "We'll add security later" | Security retrofitting is 10x harder than building it in. Add it now. |
| "No one would try to exploit this" | Automated scanners will find it. Security by obscurity is not security. |
| "The framework handles security" | Frameworks provide tools, not guarantees. You still need to use them correctly. |
| "It's just a prototype" | Prototypes become production. Security habits from day one. |
| "Threat modeling is overkill here" | Five minutes of "how would I attack this?" prevents the design flaws no control can patch later. |
| "It's just LLM output, it's only text" | That "text" can be a SQL statement, a script tag, or a shell command. Treat it like any untrusted input. |
| "The audit passed, so the dependency is safe" | Audits match known advisories. They do not detect a newly malicious package or make unreviewed install scripts safe to execute. |
| "Collect it now, we might need it later" | Data you don't hold can't be breached, subpoenaed, or mis-deleted. "Might need it" is breach scope, not a purpose. |
| "We'll handle deletion requests manually" | Manual erasure misses backups, caches, and analytics copies. If the schema can't find a user's data, you can't honor the request — design for it. |
| "Compliance is legal's problem, not ours" | Export, deletion, retention, and consent are schema and code. Legal can't bolt them on after you've smeared PII across ten systems. |

## Red Flags

- User input passed directly to database queries, shell commands, or HTML rendering
- A delete, move, or overwrite whose target comes from a payload, a config value, or another process's command line, guarded only by a shape check on the path
- Secrets in source code or commit history
- API endpoints without authentication or authorization checks
- Missing CORS configuration or wildcard (`*`) origins
- No rate limiting on authentication endpoints, or an in-memory limiter in front of more than one instance
- Stack traces or internal errors exposed to users
- Dependencies with known critical vulnerabilities, competing lockfiles at one installation boundary, non-reproducible installs, or blanket-approved scripts
- Server fetches user-supplied URLs without an allowlist (SSRF)
- LLM/model output passed into a query, the DOM, a shell, or `eval`
- Secrets, PII, or the full system prompt placed inside an LLM context window
- Personal data collected with no stated purpose, retention limit, or deletion path
- PII sent to analytics/ad/LLM vendors with no consent or data-processing agreement
- "Delete my account" that only flips a flag while the personal data lingers in stores and backups

## Verification

After implementing security-relevant code:

- [ ] The native audit has no unmitigated reachable critical/high findings; CI preserves the authoritative lockfile and blocks unreviewed dependency scripts
- [ ] No secrets in source code or git history
- [ ] All user input validated at system boundaries
- [ ] Destructive filesystem operations resolve symlinks, then verify allowlisted root, minimum depth, and ownership before running
- [ ] Authentication and authorization checked on every protected endpoint
- [ ] Security headers present in response (check with browser DevTools)
- [ ] Error responses don't expose internal details
- [ ] Rate limiting active on auth endpoints, backed by a shared store when more than one instance serves traffic
- [ ] Server-side URL fetches validated against an allowlist (no SSRF)
- [ ] LLM/model output validated and encoded before use (if AI features present)
- [ ] Personal data is classified, minimized to a stated purpose, and has a retention limit
- [ ] Deletion and export requests work end-to-end (including backups, caches, and analytics copies)
