## Hardening Controls

The rules below are the workflow; a concrete implementation of each lives in [references/hardening-patterns.md](hardening-patterns.md). Open the section you need when you reach that code, not before.

### Injection, XSS, and access control

- Parameterize every query. Never build SQL, NoSQL, or shell commands from input strings.
- Encode output through the framework's auto-escaping. If raw HTML is unavoidable, sanitize with an allowlist sanitizer first.
- Check **authorization** on every request, not just authentication: the authenticated user must own, or be permitted on, the specific resource (A01, IDOR).

Patterns: [Injection](hardening-patterns.md#injection), [XSS](hardening-patterns.md#cross-site-scripting-xss), [Access control](hardening-patterns.md#broken-access-control).

### Authentication and sessions

- Hash passwords with bcrypt (≥12 rounds), scrypt, or argon2. The session secret comes from the environment, never from code.
- Session cookies are `httpOnly`, `secure`, and `sameSite: 'lax'` or `'strict'` (the CSRF defense; `'none'` sends the cookie on cross-site requests), with a bounded `maxAge`.

Pattern: [Authentication](hardening-patterns.md#broken-authentication).

### Headers, CORS, and responses

- Security headers on every response (helmet or the framework equivalent); CSP starts from `default-src 'self'` and is tightened, not loosened.
- CORS restricted to an explicit origin list from configuration. Never `*` with credentials.
- Strip sensitive fields (`passwordHash`, reset tokens) before any response. Error bodies are generic; internals go to server logs only.

Patterns: [Misconfiguration](hardening-patterns.md#security-misconfiguration), [Sensitive data exposure](hardening-patterns.md#sensitive-data-exposure).

### Input validation and uploads

- Validate at the boundary with a schema: allowlisted shape, lengths, enums, formats. Reject with 422 and structured details; downstream code uses only the parsed, typed value.
- Uploads: allowlist MIME types, cap size, verify content (magic bytes) when it matters. The extension proves nothing.

Patterns: [Schema validation](hardening-patterns.md#schema-validation-at-boundaries), [File upload](hardening-patterns.md#file-upload-safety).

### Server-side fetches (SSRF)

Any URL the user influences — webhooks, import-from-URL, image proxies, link previews — can be aimed at internal services. Allowlist scheme and host, resolve **all** DNS records and reject any private or reserved address (loopback, link-local `169.254.169.254`, private, unique-local, for IPv4 and IPv6), and forbid redirects. That check still has a DNS-rebinding TOCTOU gap: for high-risk surfaces, pin the resolved IP or put a filtering agent in front.

Pattern: [SSRF](hardening-patterns.md#server-side-request-forgery-ssrf).

### Destructive operations on derived paths

A delete, move, or overwrite is only as safe as the value naming its target, and trust follows who *wrote* that value, not which channel delivered it: another process's command line is as attacker-controlled as a form field. A shape check proves well-formedness, not authorization. Before the call, require all three: the resolved target (symlinks resolved) sits under an **allowlisted root**; it is at least one level **below** that root; and it carries **ownership evidence read before the operation**. On refusal, log the rejected target and stop; never fall back to a broader default path.

Why the check is weaker than it reads (marker self-attestation, check/use races): [Destructive paths](hardening-patterns.md#destructive-operations-on-derived-paths). Worked code: `../../references/security-checklist.md`.

### Rate limiting

Limit the API generally and auth endpoints strictly (about 10 attempts per 15 minutes). Once more than one process serves traffic, in-memory counters silently become `max × instances`, or never fire on serverless: back the limiter with a shared store.

Pattern: [Rate limiting](hardening-patterns.md#rate-limiting).

### Secrets

Secrets come from the environment. `.env.example` is committed with placeholders; real `.env*` files and key material are gitignored; grep the staged diff before committing. **A secret that reaches a remote is compromised the moment it lands: rotate it first, then purge history.**

Pattern: [Secrets management](hardening-patterns.md#secrets-management).

### Dependencies and supply chain

1. **Find the installation boundary and manager.** Use the workspace root that owns the lockfile, or an independent nested project only when it is outside that workspace. Corroborate `packageManager` (when present), the lockfile, and CI; stop on disagreement or competing lockfiles. Pin the manager version.
2. **Block dependency scripts before first execution.** Bootstrap with scripts disabled or a documented fail-closed policy, inspect the pending script source, approve only the minimum, commit the policy, then verify with a clean frozen/immutable install. Never blanket-approve.
3. **Run the native audit against the committed lockfile before every release.** Triage critical/high by **reachability** (runtime, build, test, deploy paths) and fix availability. Never apply forced remediation (`npm audit fix --force` or equivalent) automatically, since forced fixes may cross declared dependency ranges; preview, read changelogs, test each upgrade. Document every deferral with a reason and a review date.
4. **Audits only match known advisories.** They do not catch a newly malicious or typosquatted package (`cross-env` vs `crossenv`). Review new dependencies, lockfile diffs, and script-policy changes together: ownership, maintenance, release age, provenance, transitive graph. Verify registry signatures where supported (`npm audit signatures`, `pnpm audit signatures`) and treat their absence as a signal to investigate, not automatic proof of compromise (A06, LLM03).

Triage decision tree: [Dependency audit triage](hardening-patterns.md#dependency-audit-triage). Manager matrix and install-script gate: `../../references/security-checklist.md`.

### Personal data and privacy

Hardening asks "can an attacker read it?" Privacy asks "should *we* hold it at all, and for how long?" The cheapest data to protect, breach, and comply over is the data you never collected; treat personal data as a liability to minimize.

- **Classify fields as you add them** (non-personal, PII, sensitive) and handle each class accordingly. You cannot protect, or honor a deletion request for, data you cannot find.
- **Collect only against a stated purpose.** "Might be useful later" is latent breach scope, not a purpose. Keep PII out of telemetry.
- **Set retention up front, then actually delete.** Every personal-data store needs a TTL and a working deletion path, including backups, caches, search indexes, and analytics copies.
- **Support the data-subject rights your jurisdiction requires** (GDPR, CCPA, and kin): export, correct, delete. Design the schema so a user's data is findable and erasable, not smeared irreversibly across systems.
- **Consent gates collection and third-party sharing, and is auditable.** Sending PII to an analytics, ad, or LLM vendor is sharing; the vendor needs a data-processing agreement. Make region a configurable policy, not a hardcoded assumption.

Classification table: [Data classification](hardening-patterns.md#data-classification). A privacy incident starts the breach-notification clock; run the postmortem with the `debugging` skill.

### AI / LLM features

Calling an LLM — chatbots, summarizers, agents, RAG — adds a new attack surface; map it to the [OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications (2025)](https://genai.owasp.org/llm-top-10/):

- **Model output is untrusted input** (LLM05). Never into `eval`, SQL, a shell, `innerHTML`, or a file path; parse defensively, validate against a schema, then encode.
- **Prompts can be hijacked** (LLM01). Untrusted text in the context — a user message, a fetched page, a PDF — can carry instructions. The system prompt is not a security boundary; enforce permissions in code.
- **Keep secrets, other tenants' data, and the full system prompt out of the context window** (LLM02, LLM07); scope tool permissions, validate every tool argument, and confirm destructive actions (LLM06); cap tokens, request rate, and recursion depth (LLM10); partition RAG embeddings per tenant and validate documents before indexing (LLM08).

Pattern: [LLM output handling](hardening-patterns.md#llm-output-handling).
