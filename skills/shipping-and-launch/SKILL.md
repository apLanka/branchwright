# Shipping and Launch

## Overview

Ship with confidence. The goal is not just to deploy — it's to deploy safely, with monitoring in place, a rollback plan ready, and a clear understanding of what success looks like. Every launch should be reversible, observable, and incremental.

## When to Use

- Deploying a feature to production for the first time
- Releasing a significant change to users
- Migrating data or infrastructure
- Opening a beta or early access program
- Any deployment that carries risk (all of them)

## The Pre-Launch Checklist

### Code Quality

- [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, e2e)
- [ ] Build succeeds with no warnings
- [ ] Lint and type checking pass
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] No TODO comments that should be resolved before launch
- [ ] No `console.log` debugging statements in production code
- [ ] Error handling covers expected failure modes

### Security

- [ ] No secrets in code or version control
- [ ] The ecosystem's dependency audit (`npm audit`, `pip-audit`, `cargo audit`, ...) shows no critical or high vulnerabilities
- [ ] Input validation on all user-facing endpoints
- [ ] Authentication and authorization checks in place
- [ ] Security headers configured (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- [ ] Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- [ ] CORS configured to specific origins (not wildcard)

### Performance

- [ ] Core Web Vitals within "Good" thresholds
- [ ] No N+1 queries in critical paths
- [ ] Images optimized (compression, responsive sizes, lazy loading)
- [ ] Bundle size within budget
- [ ] Database queries have appropriate indexes
- [ ] Caching configured for static assets and repeated queries

### Accessibility

- [ ] Keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements
- [ ] Screen reader can convey page content and structure
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA (4.5:1 for text)
- [ ] Focus management correct for modals and dynamic content
- [ ] Error messages are descriptive and associated with form fields
- [ ] No accessibility warnings in axe-core or Lighthouse

### Infrastructure

- [ ] Environment variables set in production
- [ ] Database migrations applied (or ready to apply)
- [ ] DNS and SSL configured
- [ ] CDN configured for static assets
- [ ] Logging and error reporting configured
- [ ] Health check endpoint exists and responds

### Documentation

- [ ] README updated with any new setup requirements
- [ ] API documentation current
- [ ] ADRs written for any architectural decisions
- [ ] Changelog updated
- [ ] User-facing documentation updated (if applicable)

## Feature Flag Strategy

Details: [Feature Flag Strategy](references/feature-flags.md).

## Staged Rollout

Details: [Staged Rollout](references/staged-rollout.md) covers: The Rollout Sequence, Rollout Decision Thresholds, When to Roll Back.

## Monitoring and Observability

Details: [Monitoring and Observability](references/monitoring.md) covers: What to Monitor, Error Reporting, Post-Launch Verification.

## Error Budget Release Gate

Your service's error budget — the fraction of requests or time your SLO allows to fail — determines whether it's safe to ship. Use it as an objective gate — not a negotiation:

```
Budget remaining > 20%  →  Ship normally; monitor closely
Budget remaining 0–20%  →  Slow rollouts only; no high-risk changes
Budget exhausted        →  Freeze feature work; focus entirely on reliability
Budget resets           →  Resume normal pace; bake in the fix that recovered it
```

A high burn rate during a canary (consuming budget faster than the baseline pace) is a **hold** signal in the rollout thresholds table above — treat it the same as an elevated error rate.

## Rollback Strategy

Every deployment needs a rollback plan before it happens:
