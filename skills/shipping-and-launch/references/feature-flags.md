## Feature Flag Strategy

Ship behind feature flags to decouple deployment from release:

```typescript
// Feature flag check
const flags = await getFeatureFlags(userId);

if (flags.taskSharing) {
  // New feature: task sharing
  return <TaskSharingPanel task={task} />;
}

// Default: existing behavior
return null;
```

**Feature flag lifecycle:**

```
1. DEPLOY with flag OFF     → Code is in production but inactive
2. ENABLE for team/beta     → Internal testing in production environment
3. GRADUAL ROLLOUT          → 5% → 25% → 50% → 100% of users
4. MONITOR at each stage    → Watch error rates, performance, user feedback
5. CLEAN UP                 → Remove flag and dead code path after full rollout
```

**Rules:**
- Every feature flag has an owner and an expiration date
- Clean up flags within 2 weeks of full rollout
- Don't nest feature flags (creates exponential combinations)
- Test both flag states (on and off) in CI
