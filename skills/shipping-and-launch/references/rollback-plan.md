## Rollback Plan for [Feature/Release]

### Trigger Conditions
- Error rate > 2x baseline
- P95 latency > [X]ms
- User reports of [specific issue]

### Rollback Steps
1. Disable feature flag (if applicable)
   OR
1. Deploy previous version: `git revert <commit> && git push`
2. Verify rollback: health check, error monitoring
3. Communicate: notify team of rollback

### Database Considerations
- Migration [X] has a rollback: <verified command or runbook link>
- Data inserted by new feature: [preserved / cleaned up]

### Time to Rollback
- Feature flag: < 1 minute
- Redeploy previous version: < 5 minutes
- Database rollback: < 15 minutes

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "It works in staging, it'll work in production" | Production has different data, traffic patterns, and edge cases. Monitor after deploy. |
| "We don't need feature flags for this" | Every feature benefits from a kill switch. Even "simple" changes can break things. |
| "Monitoring is overhead" | Not having monitoring means you discover problems from user complaints instead of dashboards. |
| "We'll add monitoring later" | Add it before launch. You can't debug what you can't see. |
| "Rolling back is admitting failure" | Rolling back is responsible engineering. Shipping a broken feature is the failure. |
| "The error rate looks fine, let's keep shipping" | Check the burn rate, not just the current error rate. Consuming budget faster than baseline is a hold signal even when individual thresholds are green. |

## Red Flags

- Deploying without a rollback plan
- No monitoring or error reporting in production
- Big-bang releases (everything at once, no staging)
- Feature flags with no expiration or owner
- No one monitoring the deploy for the first hour
- Production environment configuration done by memory, not code
- "It's Friday afternoon, let's ship it"
- Error budget exhausted but feature work continues unchanged

## Verification

Before deploying:

- [ ] Pre-launch checklist completed (all sections green)
- [ ] Feature flag configured (if applicable)
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards set up
- [ ] Team notified of deployment

After deploying:

- [ ] Health check returns 200
- [ ] Error rate is normal
- [ ] Latency is normal
- [ ] Critical user flow works
- [ ] Logs are flowing
- [ ] Rollback tested or verified ready

For every shipped service:

- [ ] Error budget policy in place: know what action to take when budget drops below 20% and when it's exhausted
